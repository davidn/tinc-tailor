; This option specifies the interface cloudfabric should use, and the 'network-
; name' for tinc. If you are using tinc, 'cf' is fine. If you are not using
; tinc this should be the interface for cloudfabric to operate on. This
; defaults to 'cf' if use_tinc = true, and 'eth0' otherwise.

; This option specifies the transport layer cloudfabric should use. 'tcp' only
; works with exactly 2 nodes. 'pgm' cannot works with arbitary number of nodes,
; but non-root users cannot send control messages to the cluster. 'epgm', which
; is recommended, can be used by non-root users and supports arbitary number of
; nodes.
